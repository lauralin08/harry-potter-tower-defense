# Harry Potter Tower Defense Game

The result of this project will be a Harry Potter -themed, 2D, single-player HTML5 Tower
Defense game. The game should appeal to both newcomers and returning fans of strategy
games, tower defense games, and the Harry Potter series alike.

The project is currently in progress and will be finished in March 2020.
